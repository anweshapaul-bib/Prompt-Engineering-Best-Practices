# PROMPT ENGINEERING- BEST PRACTICES

This project highlights the principles and techniques of prompt engineering for maximizing the effectiveness of large language models. Below, you'll find an overview of the project and its functionalities.

## Overview

In this project, I've applied two key principles for prompting:

1. **Clear and Specific Instructions**: The instructions provided to the model are clear and specific, ensuring accurate responses.
  
2. **Giving Time for Model Processing**: When appropriate, the model is given sufficient time to process the input and generate responses, enhancing the quality of outcomes.

Additionally, I've embraced iterative prompt development to refine prompts for specific applications, ensuring optimal performance. The project showcases various capabilities of large language models, including summarizing, inferring, transforming, and expanding text.

## Functionalities

- **Summarizing**: The model is capable of summarizing input text, condensing lengthy passages into concise summaries.
  
- **Inferring**: It can infer information from given prompts, providing insightful responses based on context.
  
- **Transforming**: The model transforms text according to specified criteria, facilitating tasks such as paraphrasing or rephrasing.
  
- **Expanding**: With the ability to expand text, the model can generate additional content based on the provided input.

Moreover, the project includes a custom chatbot implementation, demonstrating practical applications of large language models in conversational interfaces.
